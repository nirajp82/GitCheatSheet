To go back to a specific commit in Git and discard all the commits that came after it, you can use the `git reset` command. Here are the steps:

1. **Find the Commit Hash:**
   First, find the commit hash of the specific commit you want to go back to. You can use the `git log` command to view the commit history and find the hash of the desired commit.

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   Copy the commit hash that corresponds to the commit you want to go back to.

2. **Reset to the Specific Commit:**
   Use the `git reset` command with the `--hard` option to reset the local branch to the specific commit. Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash you copied.

   ```bash
   git reset --hard <commit-hash>
   ```

   This will move the branch pointer and the working directory to the specified commit, discarding all commits that came after it.

3. **Force Push (Optional):**
   If you have already pushed the commits you want to discard to a remote repository, you may need to force push to update the remote repository. Be cautious when force pushing, as it overwrites the remote branch history.

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

**Keep in mind that using `git reset --hard` is a destructive operation, and it discards all changes in your working directory and staging area that are not in the specified commit. Make sure you really want to discard those changes before proceeding.**

Additionally, be careful when force pushing, especially if you are collaborating with others, as it can rewrite history and cause conflicts for other contributors.
